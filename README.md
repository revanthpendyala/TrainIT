# TRAIit
About:
“trAIn it” is a game which is integrated with an AI game bot where the user trains it in the game itself by playing with it. Which is later competed with the other game bot of other player. So the skills of the bot are directly proportional to the time user spends with his/her bot.
 
Scope:
This idea can be used on all current major games, like if we take a game “Pokemon Go”, Ash trains the Pikachu by playing with it and send it to the battle field to fight with other Pokemons. 
Like-wise its span is large and can be used in all kinds of games like:
1.	Dragon fantasy games
2.	Fighting games
3.	Logic games like chess
4.	 Kid games

Our Game Plan:
To keep it simple, we initial are expecting it to use the idea in the ping pong game. Here the user is an Old wrecked bat which trains the new generation young bats (which is a bot) to play ping pong and send them to play with the other young bats of other users.


Project Plan:

Before mid-Semester exam 1:
Building basic game in Unity where a bat is used to play a ping pong.  

Before mid-Semester exam 2:
Integrating AI bot to the game to which user can train it and send to battle with other bats.

Before Comprehensive exam:
Creating a multiplayer platform where different users compete with each other.
